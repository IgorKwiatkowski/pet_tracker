# pet_tracker
Simple Django app for tracking my pets' food and meds

Hello and thank you for having a look at my first "serious" project. It was a graduation project for my Python Back End Developer course at Coders Lab.

I apologize for the mess in the branches. I was trying to rush hosting the project on AWS before the deadline, failed, and left a bit of a mess, but the develop branch should run fine locally.

I wrote this program because I needed a tool for tracking my five pets, each with their separate food and meds in different dosages, applied on different days in different intervals. This basic functionality runs alright with a small database.

Are there logins, user accounts etc?
There are no user accounts or any related features, because the program's intended use is mostly just for my wife and myself. I plan to add these features as exercise later.

How can I see days other than today?
Right now you can only pass the date into the URL in day/YYYY/MM/DD format. Links for that are coming.

Can I delete pets or products?
Not yet. Coming soon.
